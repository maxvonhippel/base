plot_walker can be called from the command line as:
> python plot_walker_base.py

A handful of things are hard-coded; only the first two need your attention:

— The first line is the path to python — maybe change it as appropriate
— Input .res file: we should grab this from the mcmc call

— Output png file is called mcmcWalkers.png
— I have set the axes to be 11,000. Could be grabbed from YAML or mcmc call to be set to nstepsMC (?)
— Figure sizes assume six columns in the .res file. Maybe it is worth making this a variable if that is likely to change.
— Two basic python libraries are used (numpy, matplotlib).
